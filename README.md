# Hidden-Markov-Models
Developed a hidden Markov model for part-of-speech (POS) tagging, using the Brown corpus as training data. The tag set used in this project will be the universal POS tag set, which is composed of the twelve POS tags NOUN (noun), VERB (verb), ADJ (adjective), ADV (adverb), PRON (pronoun), DET (determiner or article), ADP (preposition or postposition), NUM (numeral), CONJ (conjunction), PRT (particle), '.' (punctuation mark), and X (other).
